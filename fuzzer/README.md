# Fuzzing DNG SDK

This fuzzer is intented to do a varian analysis of the issue reported
in b/156261521.

Here is a list of some CVEs previously discovered in DNG SDK:

* CVE-2020-9589
* CVE-2020-9590
* CVE-2020-9620
* CVE-2020-9621
* CVE-2020-9622
* CVE-2020-9623
* CVE-2020-9624
* CVE-2020-9625
* CVE-2020-9626
* CVE-2020-9627
* CVE-2020-9628
* CVE-2020-9629

## Building & running the fuzz target: Android device

It is recommended to set rss limit to higher values (such as 4096) when running
the fuzzer to avoid frequent OOM libFuzzer crashes.

```sh
$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch aosp_arm64-eng
$ SANITIZE_TARGET=hwaddress make dng_parser_fuzzer
$ adb sync data
$ adb shell /data/fuzz/arm64/dng_parser_fuzzer/dng_parser_fuzzer \
$ -rss_limit=4096 \
$ /data/fuzz/arm64/dng_parser_fuzzer/corpus
```

## Building & running the fuzz target: Host

```sh
$ source build/envsetup.sh
$ lunch aosp_x86_64-eng
$ SANITIZE_HOST=address make dng_parser_fuzzer
$ LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$ANDROID_HOST_OUT/fuzz/x86_64/lib/ \
$ $ANDROID_HOST_OUT/fuzz/x86_64/dng_parser_fuzzer/dng_parser_fuzzer \
$ -rss_limit_mb=4096 \
$ $ANDROID_HOST_OUT/fuzz/x86_64/dng_parser_fuzzer/corpus/
```


## Lossless JPEG decoding fuzzer

The DNG format supports lossless JPEG encoding. The decoder code is quite
complex and worth some fuzzing. Unfortunately, due to the overall complexity of
DNG format, it is very hard for a simple fuzzer targetting the DNG decoding
entry point to reach and fuzz the lossless JPEG decoding enough. To improve that,
a new fuzzer is added to just targetting the lossless JPEG deocoders. Please
keep in mind, that the corpus generated by this fuzzer is not a valid DNG format,
but just the lossless JPEG binary blob inside of the DNG file. A seed corpus is
provided as seeds/LosslessJPEG/lossless.jpeg, which is extracted from
seeds/CVE_2020_9589/original.dng.
