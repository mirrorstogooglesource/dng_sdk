      "message": "The answer I got back from Adobe is they expect IsValidDNG to be called after PostParse. The gcam code should be doing this now... They accepted a couple fixes for hardening purposes, but my guess is we\u0027ll see a lot of fuzzer crashes that can\u0027t really occur in practice if the fuzzer runs without the validation.",
